# TODO App

## Overview

This is a simple TODO app built with React JS, featuring a straightforward interface for managing tasks. The app utilizes local storage for offline functionality and persistence across browser refreshes.

## Key Features

- **Input Bar:**
  - Allows users to add new TODOs by pressing the return key.

- **TODO Cards:**
  - Displays a list of TODO cards, with each TODO appended on creation.

- **Complete TODOs:**
  - Clicking on a TODO card marks it as complete and moves it to the bottom of the list.

- **Sorting:**
  - Active TODOs appear in order of creation (most recent on top).
  - Completed TODOs appear in order of completion (most recent on top).

- **Reset Button:**
  - Located on the top right corner, clears all TODOs and returns to the initial state.

## Assumptions

- The app assumes that the user has a modern web browser that supports HTML5 and local storage.

## Documentation

### Components

1. **App Component (`src/App.js`):**
   - `useEffect`: Fetches todos from local storage on component mount.
   - `handleInputChange`: Updates the inputText state when the input changes.
   - `handleAddTodo`: Adds a new todo to the list when the return key is pressed.
   - `handleCompleteTodo`: Marks a todo as complete and updates its status in local storage.
   - `handleReset`: Clears all todos and removes them from local storage.

### Styling (`src/App.css`)

1. `.App`: Styles the main container for the app.
2. `.header`: Styles the header section with the title and reset button.
3. `.reset-button`: Styles the reset button.
4. `input`: Styles the input for adding new todos.
5. `.todos-container`: Styles the container for displaying todo cards.
6. `.todo-card`: Styles individual todo cards.
7. `.completed`: Styles completed todo cards.

### Unhandled Edge Cases

1. **Empty Todo:**
   - Adding an empty todo is currently allowed. It might be desirable to prevent this by checking `inputText.trim() !== ''` before adding a new todo.

2. **Long Todos:**
   - There is no current limitation on the length of todo text. Consider adding a maximum character limit or handling long text gracefully.

3. **Browser Compatibility:**
   - The app relies on local storage, which is supported in modern browsers. Consider using additional libraries or a backend server for broader compatibility.

4. **Security:**
   - The app does not implement any authentication or authorization mechanisms. It assumes a single-user environment, and todos are stored locally. For a multi-user environment or increased security, consider implementing user authentication and a server-side database.

### Additional Considerations

1. **Offline Mode:**
   - The app should work in offline mode, as it uses local storage. However, the user might not receive immediate feedback about the success or failure of data storage. Consider implementing a mechanism to handle offline data synchronization when the network becomes available.

2. **Responsive Design:**
   - The current styling is basic and may not be fully responsive on all devices. Enhance the styles to ensure a good user experience on various screen sizes.

3. **Accessibility:**
   - Ensure that the app is accessible to users with disabilities. This includes providing alternative text for images, keyboard navigation, and other accessibility best practices.

4. **Testing:**
   - Implement unit tests for critical functions and components to ensure stability and reliability, especially as the app grows in complexity.
